3.4 Director Profile
Musoke Ahmed Kirumira
Founder & Director – Southern Hemisphere Foundation
Musoke Ahmed Kirumira’s journey is rooted in a simple but powerful belief: every child no matter their background deserves a chance to dream, learn, and become someone great. This conviction was born from his encounters with children in his community who faced hardship, abandonment, and limited access to education. Rather than look away, Musoke chose to act.
In 2009, with little more than courage, personal sacrifice, and an unshakable vision, he opened a small community school that welcomed children who had nowhere else to go. He carried the weight of the mission on his shoulders often funding school activities from his own pocket, walking long distances to ensure children reached home safely, and creating a space where every learner felt seen, valued, and protected. What began with just three children became the seed that would grow into the Southern Hemisphere Foundation.
Today, Musoke leads the Foundation with the same heart-driven purpose that fueled its beginning. His leadership blends compassion with strategy, ensuring that every program, partnership, and initiative uplifts the children and communities the Foundation serves. He continues to inspire teams, empower youth, and champion opportunities for the vulnerable turning barriers into stepping stones for countless young lives.
Musoke’s vision remains clear: to build a future where every child can rise, and where communities thrive because no one is left behind. His story is not just one of leadership, but of love, resilience, and unwavering belief in the power of education to transform generations

ORGANIZATION HISTORY 
OUR STORY SO FAR
In the quiet community of Bunamwaya, Makindye–Ssabagabo, a story of compassion, courage, and transformation began long before the Southern Hemisphere Foundation (SHF) was formally established. What is now a growing beacon of hope for vulnerable children started humbly with a school, three learners, and belief that every child, regardless of background, deserves a safe place to learn, grow, and dream.
On 3rd February 2009, the directors of what would eventually become SHF opened a small community school with only three children: one belonging to the director, one needy child who had nowhere else to go, and one paying learner whose tuition helped keep the doors open. With only two staff members and no resources to spare, the school’s foundation was built not on wealth, but on sacrifice. Every day, the director carried one of the children from Bunamwaya to Ssaguku–Mukaaga stage to meet their parents for three months straight. Transport was expensive, the school was new, and the future was uncertain, but the mission was clear: no child should be denied education or care simply because their family is struggling.
By the end of the first term, enrollment grew from 3 to 8 children. It was a small number, but it marked the beginning of a vision that would one day expand far beyond academics. As the years passed, the directors began to witness deeper realities affecting the children under their care. Many learners came from homes marked by poverty, domestic instability, neglect, and emotional hardship. Some struggled with trauma and lacked even the most basic needs food, clothing, sanitary supplies, safe shelter, and supportive guardians. The school became a sanctuary, the teachers became counselors and the directors became guardians. It soon became clear that the children needed far more than lessons they needed protection, psychosocial support, nutrition, stability, and hope.
Families unable to provide meals brought children to school hungry. Some learners arrived with torn cloths, others with no books, and many with heavy emotional burdens. The school began to offer counseling, meals, uniforms, and support often funded directly from the pockets of the directors. This daily experience revealed a hard truth: education without welfare is incomplete.
A classroom cannot heal hunger, trauma, or poverty alone. 
 Driven by compassion and a deep understanding of the community’s struggles, the directors made a life-changing decision to establish the Southern Hemisphere Foundation (SHF) to bridge the widening gap between children’s needs and the limited support systems available to poor households. What began as a school-based intervention expanded into a foundation capable of addressing issues such as ;
	child vulnerability and abuse
	poverty and economic hardship
	school dropout
	lack of healthcare and nutrition
	domestic instability
	climate vulnerability and poor sanitation
With this, SHF became the humanitarian arm of the school transforming a simple learning institution into a holistic center of care. Over time, SHF developed programs designed to empower the entire community. Learners began receiving school support, counseling, mentorship, and nutrition. Families burdened by poverty received relief and guidance. Youth gained empowerment opportunities. SHF became more than a foundation, it became a lifeline.
Every child supported, every home strengthened, and every young person guided marked another milestone in our growth. Today, SHF stands as a symbol of resilience and community-driven transformation in Bunamwaya and beyond proof that when compassion meets action, entire generations can rise.
The story of the (SHF) is a story still being written born not out of long history, but out of urgent need, compassion, and a deep realization that children under our care required more than classroom instruction.
In August of this very year, the proprietors of our school made a pivotal observation: many of the learners they served were carrying burdens that extended far beyond the reach of academics. A growing number faced challenges rooted in poverty, unstable home environments, lack of emotional support, and limited access to basic necessities. These were not isolated cases they were becoming a pattern, a silent cry for help from children who could not speak for themselves. 
Recognizing this widening gap, the proprietors sat together and asked a life-changing question:
“How can we ensure that the vulnerable children under our care receive the support they truly need?”
The answer became the foundation. What began as a simple, genuine desire to help vulnerable learners quickly transformed into a structured vision to create an organization capable of offering long-term protection, empowerment, and holistic care. And so, in August, the (SHF) was conceived not as a charity project, but as a responsibility and a promise.
Day after day, the proprietors witnessed learners arriving hungry, emotionally distressed, withdrawn, or struggling silently with difficult home situations. Some lacked scholastic materials, others lacked stability but all needed support that the school alone could not sustainably provide. It became clear that:
	A school can teach,
	But a foundation can protect.
	A school can nurture the mind,
	But a foundation can heal the heart.
	A school can offer learning,
	But a foundation can offer opportunity, welfare, and hope.
With commitment and compassion, the proprietors chose to establish SHF as a development-focused, child-centered, community-rooted foundation dedicated to serving the vulnerable children and families in Bunamwaya and the surrounding communities. SHF was formed to:
	rescue vulnerable learners
	support children facing hardship
	strengthen families
	provide psychosocial and emotional support
	promote education for all
	enhance community resilience
	stand in the gap where others have failed to reach
What started as a school-based idea quickly grew into a broader vision for community transformation. Though SHF is young, its purpose is powerful. The foundation stands today as a symbol of new beginnings a movement created from genuine love for children and a determination to give every learner the chance to grow with dignity, stability, and hope.
This is just the beginning.
Our story is unfolding.
And with every child we support, SHF writes its next chapter.
